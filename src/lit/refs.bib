	abstract = {Healthy sensors are essential for the reliable monitoring and control of building automation systems (BAS). This paper presents a diagnostic tool to be used to assist building automation systems for online sensor heath monitoring and fault diagnosis of air-handling units. The tool employs a robust sensor fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) strategy based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. Two PCA models are built corresponding to the heat balance and pressure-flow balance of an air-handling process. Sensor faults are detected using the Q-statistic and diagnosed using an isolation-enhanced PCA method that combines the Q-contribution plot and knowledge-based analysis. The PCA models are updated using a condition-based adaptive scheme to follow the normal shifts in the process due to changing operating conditions. The sensor FDD strategy, the implementation of the diagnostic tool and experimental results in an existing building are presented in this paper.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12918-015-0234-3},
	abstract = {Background: Parameter estimation represents one of the most significant challenges in systems biology. This is because biological models commonly contain a large number of parameters among which there may be functional interrelationships, thus leading to the problem of non-identifiability. Although identifiability analysis has been extensively studied by analytical as well as numerical approaches, systematic methods for remedying practically non-identifiable models have rarely been investigated.
Results: We propose a simple method for identifying pairwise correlations and higher order interrelationships of parameters in partially observed linear dynamic models. This is made by derivation of the output sensitivity matrix and analysis of the linear dependencies of its columns. Consequently, analytical relations between the identifiability of the model parameters and the initial conditions as well as the input functions can be achieved. In the case of structural non-identifiability, identifiable combinations can be obtained by solving the resulting homogenous linear equations. In the case of practical non-identifiability, experiment conditions (i.e. initial condition and constant control signals) can be provided which are necessary for remedying the non-identifiability and unique parameter estimation. It is noted that the approach does not consider noisy data. In this way, the practical non-identifiability issue, which is popular for linear biological models, can be remedied. Several linear compartment models including an insulin receptor dynamics model are taken to illustrate the application of the proposed approach.
Conclusions: Both structural and practical identifiability of partially observed linear dynamic models can be clarified by the proposed method. The result of this method provides important information for experimental design to remedy the practical non-identifiability if applicable. The derivation of the method is straightforward and thus the algorithm can be easily implemented into a software packet.},

	abstract = {Three different lines of thinking (mechanical, mixed thermodynamical-mechanical, statistical thermodynamic) are presented to derive the noted barometric formula, which gives the altitude dependence of the pressure of a gas in a gravity field. It is shown that the first two methods can be extended to non-isothermal cases, whereas statistical thermodynamics relies on the concept of thermal equilibrium and its usefulness is limited to the isothermal barometric formula. The temperature changes in the gravity field are taken into account by two different methods: simple conservation of energy, and a more refined line of thought based on the adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas. The changes in gravitational acceleration are also considered in further refinements. Overall, six different formulas are derived and their usefulness is tested on the atmosphere of the Earth. It is found that none of the formulas is particularly useful above an altitude of 20 km because radiation effects make the temperature changes in the atmosphere difficult to predict by simple theories. Finally, the different components of air are also considered separately in the context of the barometric formula, and it is shown that the known composition changes of the atmosphere are primarily caused by photochemical processes and not by the gravity field.},

FBW systems have been in use in guided missiles and subsequently in military aircraft.

Software generation contributes significantly to the total engineering development cost of the high integrity digital FBW systems. Issues related to software and redundancy techniques are discussed. The leading commercial aircraft manufacturers, such as Airbus and Boeing, exploit FBW controls in their civil airliners.

Since the noise PSD is unknown in advance, estimation from the noisy speech signal is necessary. An overestimation of the noise PSD will lead to a loss in speech quality, while an underestimation will lead to an unnecessary high level of residual noise. We present a novel approach for noise tracking, which updates the noise PSD for each DFT coefﬁcient in the presence of both speech and noise. This method is based on the eigenvalue decomposition of correlation matrices that are constructed from time series of noisy DFT coefﬁcients. The presented method is very well capable of tracking gradually changing noise types. In comparison to state-of-the-art noise tracking algorithms the proposed method reduces the estimation error between the estimated and the true noise PSD. In combination with an enhancement system the proposed method improves the segmental SNR with several decibels for gradually changing noise types. Listening experiments show that the proposed system is preferred over the state-of-the-art noise tracking algorithm.},

This paper investigates an analytical alternative to hardware redundancy requiring a mathematical model of faulted and unfaulted pitotstatic probes. The most common probe faults–debris, ice, or water blockages–are modeled using physical air data relationships and experimental wind tunnel data. These models are used with a linear model of the NASA GTM aircraft at one ﬂight condition to design robust fault detection ﬁlters. Two linear H∞ ﬁlters are designed to detect faults, reject disturbances, and provide robustness to model errors. Performance is evaluated using experimentally derived fault models with nonlinear aircraft simulations that incorporate actuator uncertainty.},

We show that the MIMO PTF does not depend on the unknown initial state or the unknown excitation. We also characterize the order and relative degree of the MIMO PTF. To consistently estimate the Markov parameters of the MIMO PTF in the presence of sensor noise, we use quadratically constrained least squares identiﬁcation for MIMO systems.

Whereas the application of the FAIR principles as a guideline to provide all collected data with rich metadata that allow for finding, accessing, interoperating with and reusing the data effectively is constantly growing within science and research, the usage in an industrial scenario is largely un­ explored. Today, collected industrial data is often stored in arbitrary data formats without appropriate metadata describing the data content and is therefore lost for future reuse because crucial information on how to find, access and interoperate with the data is missing. Moreover, insufficiently described or missing data can lead to wrong decisions. In order to implement the FAIR principles for industrial sensor data, this article derives the major deficits and challenges of making industrial sensor data FAIR. Furthermore, the authors propose a threelayer architecture of FAIR sensor services, which handles the discussed challenges, to acquire FAIR sensor data at the time of measurement.

	abstract = {A main prerequisite to applications in the Internet of Production is the integration of sensor data into an interconnected infrastructure, which in turn requires expert knowledge of sensor implementation as well as of network architecture design and communication protocols. To reduce complexity in this concern, the authors propose the SensOr Interfacing Language (SOIL), a domain-specific programming language for sensor interface definition and exchange of metrological data. Based on a meta-model, the functional interface can be designed without prior knowledge of the underlying communication details. It is composed of instances of components, parameters, functions and measurements as core elements of SOIL. Subsequently, the interface is automatically defined on protocol level and its software implementation is generated, leaving only the hardware-specific implementation to the developer. The domain-specific language is prototyped and evaluated by implementing and integrating interfaces for a virtual laser tracker and a distributed temperature measurement system, confirming the envisaged benefits.},

	abstract = {Transmissibility is a mathematical model that relates a subset of a system’s outputs to another subset of outputs of the same system without knowledge of the external excitation or the dynamics of the system. This study investigates fault detection, localization, and mitigation of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) platoons using transmissibility operators. A CAV platoon is a network of connected autonomous vehicles that communicate together to move in a speciﬁc path with the desired velocity. Failure in a physical component of a vehicle, or failure in the form of an internal delay, a cyber-attack, or a communication time-delay affects the safety and security of the CAV platoons. In this paper, we use measurements from sensors available in CAV platoons to identify transmissibility operators, which are used for health monitoring, fault localization, and fault mitigation in the platoon. We ﬁrst consider the case of vehicle-to-cloud communication (V2C) to monitor the platoon’s health. Then, we assume that the platoon loses communication with the cloud, and we monitor the health of the platoon based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We apply the proposed technique to a model of the platoon obtained using the bond graph approach, and an experimental setup consisting of three connected autonomous robots.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates transmissibility operators for time-variant systems with bounded nonlinearities. Transmissibility operators are mathematical relations between a set of system responses to another set of responses within the same system. Both parameter variation and system nonlinearities are considered to be unknown. Transmissibility operators are shown in the literature to be independent of the system inputs. The bounded nonlinearities are considered as independent excitations on the system, which renders transmissibilities independent of these nonlinearities. To overcome the unknown parameter variation, we propose identifying transmissibilities using recursive least-squares in the form of noncausal FIR models. The recursive least squares algorithm is used to optimize what dynamics to include in the transmissibility operator, and what dynamics to exclude with the system nonlinearities. The identiﬁed transmissibilities then become robust against parameter variation and unknown nonlinearities. Next, transmissibilities are proposed for fault detection an autonomous multi-robotic system formulated to emulate connected autonomous vehicle platoons. The variant parameters are the robot mass and the ground friction coefﬁcient.},

Using IIR models, however, requires knowledge of the system order, which, if chosen incorrectly, may yield poor parameter estimates. On the other hand, ﬁniteimpulse-response (FIR) models of sufﬁciently high order can approximate asymptotically stable systems without knowledge of the system order. However, FIR models cannot approximate systems with poles located outside the open unit disk. In this paper we introduce a composite FIR/IIR (CFI) model, which is the product of a possibly noncausal FIR model and a poleonly IIR model. CFI models are shown to more accurately approximate systems with arbitrary poles under the condition that a lower bound on the number of poles located outside the open unit disk is known.},

This raises the question as to whether it is possible to model the response of a subset of sensors based on the response of the remaining sensors without knowledge of the driving input. To address this issue, we develop time-domain sensor-to-sensor models that account for nonzero initial conditions. The sensor-to-sensor model is in the form of a transmissibility operator that is a rational function of the differentiation operator. The development is carried out for both SISO and MIMO transmissibility operators. These time-domain sensor-to-sensor models can be used for diagnostics and output prediction.},

We use system identiﬁcation techniques to identify the NMP zero, and use this information in RCAC. We consider both full-state feedback and output feedback, and in both cases we follow step commands with transitioning dynamics. We ﬁrst consider the case where RCAC is unaware of the change and NMP zero identiﬁcation is unavailable to RCAC. We then assume that NMP zero information is available to RCAC from system identiﬁcation.},

We show that FIR models can be used effectively for closed-loop identiﬁcation of open-loop-unstable plants. The key insight in this regard is to realize that a noncausal FIR model can serve as a truncated Laurent expansion inside the annulus between the asymptotically stable pole of largest modulus and the unstable pole of smallest modulus. The key to identifying the noncausal plant model is to delay the measured output relative to the measured input. With this techniques, the identiﬁed FIR model is precisely a noncausal approximation of the unstable plant, that is, an approximation of the Laurent expansion of the plant inside the annulus of analyticity lying between the disk of stable poles and the punctured plane of unstable poles.},

	abstract = {An important step in model-based fault detection is residual evaluation, where residuals are evaluated with the aim to detect changes in their behavior caused by faults. To handle residuals subject to time-varying uncertainties and disturbances, which indeed are present in practice, a novel statistical residual evaluation approach is presented. The main contribution is to base the residual evaluation on an explicit comparison of the probability distribution of the residual, estimated online using current data, with a no-fault residual distribution. The no-fault distribution is based on a set of a-priori known no-fault residual distributions, and is continuously adapted to the current situation. As a second contribution, a method is proposed for estimating the required set of no-fault residual distributions oﬀ-line from no-fault training data. The proposed residual evaluation approach is evaluated with measurement data on a residual for fault detection in the gas-ﬂow system of a Scania truck diesel engine. Results show that small faults can be reliable detected with the proposed approach in cases where regular methods fail.},

	abstract = {The DigTwin project, launched at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in 2018, is the first to bundle the developments on the topic of digital twins in aviation. This project is continued by the follow-up project Digital Twins for Engine Component Aircraft Technologies (DigECAT, 2022-2025). In addition to the development of digital twins as research objects for aircraft, components and engines, an important building block is the development of digital twins as a tool for DLR research aircraft. This digital twin will be used as a service to enlarge the availability of research data within the organization. The DLR operates a large research fleet of 12 aircraft with different on-board measurement systems in the areas of aircraft systems, aerodynamics, structure and environment. The developments are modular and scalable and will be extended to other systems, e.g. UAVs, of which DLR is operating a large and diverse fleet.},
