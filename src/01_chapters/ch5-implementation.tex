\chapter{Implementation}

Interfacing: Clean interfaces are generated throughout the model. Enabling a standardized state vector x. Meaning that A remains standardized for any aircraft while B, U and L need to be adjusted for any changes to the aircraft or sensor data.

The integration step may be omitted in early design stages since the necessary equations and equilibriums of Forces and Moments could only be modelled linearly while neglecting various unknown factors like shifting CG due to fuel burn, actual Inertia of Aircraft and aicraft mass. Hence, this step may be implemented if time allows it.
